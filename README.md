# Task 8: Exploring VPN Use for Online Privacy

## 🔍 Purpose
The goal of this task was to install and test a free VPN service, understand how it works, and see how it changes your IP and encrypts traffic.

## 🧰 Tool Used
- VPN Service: ProtonVPN (Free Plan)

## ✅ Steps I Followed
1. Registered for ProtonVPN
2. Installed their Windows VPN app
3. Connected to a random free VPN server
4. Checked my IP before and after using whatismyipaddress.com
5. Tried loading a few websites and confirmed encryption
6. Disconnected VPN and noticed slight increase in speed

## 🖼 Screenshots
