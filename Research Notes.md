# VPN Explained – Simple Research Notes

## 🌐 What’s a VPN?
VPN stands for Virtual Private Network. It creates a private and secure connection between you and the internet.

## 🔐 Why Use It?
- Hides your real IP address
- Encrypts your internet traffic
- Helps protect your data on public Wi-Fi

## 🔁 VPN vs Proxy
- VPN = Full device encryption
- Proxy = Just changes location for browser

## 🛑 Things VPN Can't Do
- Doesn’t make you 100% anonymous
- Won’t protect you from viruses or bad links
- Free VPNs can be slower and limited

## 📌 Common VPN Protocols
- OpenVPN: Very secure and popular
- WireGuard: New, faster, and strong encryption
- IKEv2: Good for mobile use
